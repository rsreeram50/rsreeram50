I only recently understood how HTML can be used to build websites as part of classroom training I received at ByteLabs.com. I am able to understand how reusable code
can be used to build apps and websites even by novices. I am really grateful to be able to program in HTML and PHP. I am deeply humbled that I do have
the ability to enjoy and maybe contribute to the coding community. Thanks.
